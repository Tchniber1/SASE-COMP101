# NUMERICAL METHODS FOR APPLIED SCIENCES
### AMATH141 ECTS: 3
### PREREQUISITES: None SEMESTER: 1
## COURSE DESCRIPTION
This course introduces the foundational concepts and basic algorithms of numerical methods used in applied mathematics, science, and
engineering. Emphasis is placed on understanding how numerical errors arise, how algorithms converge, and how discrete approximations
are constructed and analyzed. Topics include floating-point arithmetic and error analysis, numerical solution of nonlinear equations, basic
numerical linear algebra, interpolation and approximation, numerical integration, and the numerical solution of initial value problems for
ordinary differential equations. The course focuses on algorithmic reasoning, stability, and efficiency, and develops hands-on computational
intuition through simple numerical experiments. It provides the necessary foundations for more advanced modeling and simulation courses in later
semesters.
